## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

    Our overall approach was to divide up the work. We had a few stages that we worked through, the first being ideation. This was still while we were forming our group, but we were coming up with the idea for what we wanted to do with our project. Then we started breaking things down into coding pieces, which we then divided up so that each of us would be able to code some classes. We then worked on the game loop, and the end stages of the project we worked on refining things together, and dividing up the remaining work that needed to be done to tie up loose ends.


 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

    The biggest new thing I learned was the idea of a game loop and a do while loop. Once it was explained it made sense, but I was initially super confused as to how the game would run.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?

    I feel like Boat could have been implemented differently to make it more easily involved in the story. As it is an item, there are some less than optimal ways we used it to achieve our win condition, and I feel like that could have been modified. I also wish the game loop was less bulky, but I'm not entirely sure how to fix that.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

    Definitely more endings. We had a couple of ideas for different endings that we wanted to implement, to give the user more choice in their outcomes, but we utimately ran out of time before we were able to implement them. Also, a combat system would have been really interesting to implement. Having monsters and needing to fight them off to get items to fix your boat would have been super interesting. In that case we would need a monsters class, and likely a rehauling of the game loop to be able to account for combat, perhaps a nested loop would work well in that situation.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

    I think simplifying my code and making sure I am commenting it while I am working on it. Especially for the game loop, the stuff I made was not always intuitive, so I added in some extra comments to make it easier to follow. Sonali Bellam

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

    Don't attempt to do too much. We had big plans at the beginning, and I really had to rely on my team members to help pare it down into something managable that I could be happy with.

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.

    I definitely think working with a team helped me. It firstly decreased the amount of stress I felt while working on the project, as I did not have nearly as many things to do as if I was doing it alone. One thing that I personally found challenging was letting my teammates take on more work. I have a particular way of doing things, and I struggled somewhat with being ok with letting other people find solutions that were different from what I had in mind but that still worked. Overall though, I think we worked well together. Elaine was really good at setting up goals for us to follow and making sure we didn't have too much going on, and Abby was really consistent and was really creative, which led us to include new ideas that I had been really confused and stuck on.

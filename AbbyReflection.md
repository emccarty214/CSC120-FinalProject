 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 My approach was to take things one at a time. My group decided to seperate what each of us wanted to do, so I had to implement the various items and the map, which also led me to work on the main, location, and coordinate classes. I think I just tried to get a base version of the classes done, and then just continue from there because it is a lot easier to edit something rather than try to start from scratch, even if that something is pretty bad or buggy.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 I had to learn how to use a 2-D array to create a map of the various locations on the map. It was hard to match the real life x-coordinate and y-coordinate (what we expect) to become how a 2-D array works. It took a lot of experimentation, but eventually got done!

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 I wish we could have made the main class into another class or seperate some of it into another gameLoop specific class so that it was cleaner, but I think in the end it ended up being OK to read and look through.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 If we had unlimted time, I think we would add enemies that you would have to kill or some other roadblocks on the way to escaping the island. I would also have more objects to pick up, for example the unused coconut class was there because we wanted to add another way to lose (not having enough food). I would also want to add NPC's in the village that you would have to talk to in order to complete the boat.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 I think Kendall gave me good advice on how to quickly make the game a little more fun to play and more intuitive, which led to better in-game directions and a better help section.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 I would say to not expect to make something insane unless you are dedicated to spending a lot of time on it. I had many finals to study for, so I wasn't able to spend as much time as I wanted coding this project. Thus, basically lower your expectations for your game, because in the end you will still have created something cool.

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.

 Working in a team was a fun experience because we were able to delegate work instead of completing the entire project on our own, which
 I think was very helpful for managing both my stress and my time. I think we had a good dynamic and met up weekly, which was helpful. We 
 were able to all work on seperate parts and then put them together, which was helpful.
